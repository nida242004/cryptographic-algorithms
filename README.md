# Cryptography & Network Security Assignment ( in c++ )

**Subject:** Cryptography & Network Security  
**Subject Code:** 22CS552  
**Academic Year:** 2024-25  

## Assignment Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing fundamental cryptographic algorithms. The goal is to enhance understanding of encryption, decryption, and key management through practical coding exercises.

## Tasks

1. **Implement Affine Cipher**
   - Encrypt a given text using the Affine Cipher technique.
   - Decrypt the text to retrieve the original message.

2. **Implement Vigenere Cipher**
   - Encrypt a message using a given keyword.
   - Decrypt the encrypted message using the same keyword.

3. **Implement Extended Euclidean Algorithm**
   - Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
   - Find the modular inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

4. **Implement RSA Algorithm**
   - Select values for e, d, and n.
   - Encrypt a word using the public key (e, n).
   - Decrypt the message using the private key (d, n).

5. **Implement El-Gamal Encryption**
   - Select values for e1, e2, r, and d.
   - Compute ciphertext components c1 and c2.
   - Decrypt the message using d.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit your source code along with a report explaining the implementation.
- Provide sample inputs and outputs for each implementation.
- Ensure the code is well-documented with comments.
- Submit the assignment before the deadline as specified by the instructor.

## Tools & Technologies
- Preferred programming languages: Python, C, or Java.
